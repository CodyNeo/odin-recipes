    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion, leek, and garlic; cook and stir until onion is transparent. Add ground beef; cook and stir until still slightly pink and about halfway done.</li>
        <li>Season with cumin, cardamom, salt, and pepper; mix well. Continue cooking until beef is browned and crumbly. Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
        <li>Mix flour and water together in a small bowl to make a thin paste. Using one wrapper at a time, fold into the shape of a cone.</li>
        <li>Fill cone with beef mixture, close the top, and seal with paste. Repeat until wrappers or filling are used up.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). There should be enough oil to submerge sambusas. Fry sambusas, a few at a time, in hot oil until golden brown</li>
        <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
    </ol>
